> **Status:** Online | **Protocol:** Sentinel dVPN | **Identity:** Unknown

**ChibaTunnel** is a cyberpunk-styled desktop dVPN client engineered for absolute privacy and censorship resistance. It cuts through centralized corporate firewalls by routing your traffic across a trustless, peer-to-peer node network.

### ⛩️ Built for the Digital Underground ⚡
* **The Stack:** Crafted with **Electron**, **React**, and **TypeScript** for a fluid, resource-efficient desktop experience.
* **The Core:** Powered by the **Sentinel Protocol** ecosystem, ensuring no central logs, no single points of failure, and complete user sovereignty.
* **The Armor:** Dual-engine routing utilizing **WireGuard** for raw speed and **V2Ray** for stealth obfuscation through restrictive networks.

*An open-source gateway wrapped in electric cyan and neon magenta. Welcome to the Street.*

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This application is open source and was created for the Sentinel community. **100%** of the client code was created by AI. I wanted to play around a bit, but I just supervised. This shows how the power of the [sentinel-js-sdk](https://github.com/sentinel-official/sentinel-js-sdk/) combined with a tool like AI can create something amazing! A simple prompt like "create a VPN client using the SDK documented at https://sentinel-official.github.io/sentinel-js-sdk/: " is all it takes. The source of the nodes is: https://sentnodes.com/ Thanks! 💙 I'm not sure everything works perfectly, especially on Winzozz, but I'm pretty confident on Linux 😎.

A high-performance, cyberpunk-styled desktop application for the [Sentinel](https://sentinel.co)
Decentralised VPN network. Built with **Electron**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, this client
provides a secure, private, and censorship-resistant internet experience on the Cosmos SDK ecosystem.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌍 Multilingual Support (i18n)
Full internationalisation for **9 languages** with dynamic switching:
**English, Italiano, Русский, Español, Deutsch, Français, 中文, فارسی, العربية**
Native **RTL (Right-to-Left)** support with full UI mirroring for Arabic and Persian.

### 🌐 Node Discovery
- **3D Interactive Globe** — explore the Sentinel network via a D3.js orthographic globe.
- **Advanced Filtering** — by city, country, status, provider type, and whitelist.
- **Bookmarking** — save favourite nodes for instant reconnect.

### 🔐 Security
- **Main Process Isolation** — mnemonics and private keys live exclusively in the Electron main process. They never cross the IPC bridge to the sandboxed renderer.
- **OS-Native Encryption** — credentials encrypted via `safeStorage` (macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, Linux libsecret).
- **Hardened Sandboxing** — renderer runs with `contextIsolation: true`.

### 🛡️ VPN Engines
- **WireGuard** — high-performance kernel-level tunnels.
- **V2Ray** — obfuscated proxy (VMess/VLess) for restricted networks.
- **Transparent Proxy** — route all system traffic through V2Ray via `tun2socks`.
- **Kill Switch** — leak protection via `iptables` (Linux), `pf` (macOS), Windows Firewall.
- **Split Tunneling** — route specific subnets only (WireGuard).
- **DNS over HTTPS** — Cloudflare, Google, NextDNS, and custom resolvers.

### 🔧 Privileged Helper Service
All operations requiring elevated privileges are delegated to a background service
(`chibatunnel-helper`) that is installed once and runs silently thereafter.
No repeated password prompts or UAC dialogs during normal use.

- **Windows**: a Scheduled Task running as `SYSTEM` is configured by the installer.
- **Linux**: a `systemd` service installed by the package — `apt install` handles it automatically.
- **macOS**: a `LaunchDaemon` installed on first launch with a single password prompt.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid

  subgraph Pay-Per-Use
    A1[Choose Node] --> B1[Start Session & Escrow Deposit]
  end
  
  subgraph Plan Subscription
    A2[Choose Plan] --> B2[Subscribe to Plan]
    B2 --> C2[Select Node from Pool]
    C2 --> D2[Start Session from Allocation]
  end

  B1 --> E[Handshake with Node]
  D2 --> E
  
  E --> F[Generate Config]
  F --> G{VPN Type?}
  G -->|WireGuard| H[wg-up via Helper]
  G -->|V2Ray| I[spawn v2ray / tun2socks]
  H --> J[Tunnel Active]
  I --> J
```

### Privileged Operations Flow

```mermaid

  Electron["Electron App\n(user-level)"]
  Helper["chibatunnel-helper\n(SYSTEM / root)"]
  T2S["tun2socks\n(child of helper)"]
  WG["wireguard.exe\nwg-quick"]
  KS["Kill Switch\nFirewall rules"]

  Electron -->|"TCP JSON IPC\n127.0.0.1:47391"| Helper
  Helper -->|"spawn stdio:ignore"| T2S
  Helper -->|"installtunnelservice\nwg-quick up"| WG
  Helper -->|"netsh / iptables / pf"| KS
```

**Why a separate helper?**
Without it, spawning `tun2socks` from Electron via a PowerShell UAC wrapper caused
`await` to hang indefinitely — the daemon inherited Electron's pipe handles and the
OS never closed them. The helper eliminates this by owning all long-lived processes
in its own process tree with `stdio: 'ignore'`.

### Multi-Wallet Management

- Import multiple BIP-39 mnemonics.
- Live balance tracking for DVPN and IBC tokens.
- On-chain session monitoring: view and cancel active P2P sessions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Platform | How it's handled |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Node.js ≥ 18 | All | Build toolchain — install manually |
| `wg-quick` | Linux | **Auto-installed** as package dependency |
| `wg-quick` | macOS | `brew install wireguard-tools` (guided in-app) |
| WireGuard | Windows | **Bundled** — `wireguard.exe` included in installer |
| `v2ray` | All | **Bundled** — included in installer |
| `tun2socks` | All | **Bundled** — included in installer |
| `wintun.dll` | Windows | **Bundled** — included alongside tun2socks |

> **Note for Linux AppImage users**: if `wg-quick` is not already installed,
> the app will display the correct install command for your distribution.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Terminal 1 — start the privileged helper (elevated terminal required)
npm run dev:helper

# Terminal 2 — start Electron with hot-reload
npm run dev
```

> The helper must be started first. It runs on `127.0.0.1:47391`.

### Build

```bash
npm run build          # JS bundles only
npm run build:helper:win    # helper EXE for Windows
npm run build:helper:linux  # helper binary for Linux
npm run build:helper:mac    # helper binary for macOS
```

## 🔗 Custom Deep Link Protocol (`chibatun://`)

ChibaTunnel supports deep linking via the custom scheme `chibatun://`. This allows external websites, portals, or dashboards to initiate connection flows directly within the client, pre-filling parameters so the user only has to click **Connect**.

### 📡 Protocol Format

```text
chibatun://connect?node=<sentnode_address>[&type=<type>][&amount=<amount>]
```

#### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Accepted Values | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `node` | `sentnode1...` | **Yes** | — | Cosmos/Sentinel address of the target node. |
| `type` | `gigabytes` \| `hours` | No | `gigabytes` | Subscription type unit. |
| `amount` | Positive integer (e.g., `5`, `24`) | No | `1` | Subscription duration or bandwidth quantity. |

> [!NOTE]
> If the `node` parameter does not start with `sentnode`, the deep link is considered invalid and is silently ignored to prevent arbitrary protocol execution or crashes.

---

### ⚡ Fast-Boot Path vs. Standard Boot

To deliver a seamless experience, ChibaTunnel implements a **Fast-Boot Path** for cold starts initiated by deep links.

* **Standard Boot (No Deep Link)**: Performs environment checks, loads stored wallet, fetches all nodes (~200+ nodes), plans, provider batches, subscription details, and active sessions sequentially. This can take several seconds depending on blockchain RPC speed.
* **Fast-Boot Path (Cold Start Deep Link)**:
  1. Checks binaries and loads the wallet.
  2. Bypasses the complete node list, plans, and session histories.
  3. Queries **only** the target node's info (`fetchNodeInfo`) and existing subscription state.
  4. Bypasses the standard main screen and immediately opens the **Node Connection Modal** with pre-filled details.
  5. Triggers standard lists fetching (`fetchAllBackground()`) in the background so lists are ready when the modal is closed.

---

### 🖥️ Integration & Testing

You can trigger the protocol scheme using terminal commands or native OS utilities to test integrating portals.

#### 1. CLI/Terminal (Development Mode)
Simulate deep linking from the command line while running in developer mode:

```bash
# Windows (cold start simulation)
npx electron . "chibatun://connect?node=sentnode1abc123xyz&type=hours&amount=24"

# macOS / Linux (cold start simulation)
npx electron . "chibatun://connect?node=sentnode1abc123xyz&type=gigabytes&amount=5"
```

#### 2. Native OS Testing (App Running or Built)
Test using default system protocol dispatchers:

```bash
# macOS
open "chibatun://connect?node=sentnode1abc123xyz&type=gigabytes&amount=10"

# Linux (using xdg-open)
xdg-open "chibatun://connect?node=sentnode1abc123xyz&type=hours&amount=2"

# Windows (Command Prompt or Run dialog)
start chibatun://connect?node=sentnode1abc123xyz
```

## 📦 Distribution

Binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS are built and published automatically
via GitHub Actions on every version tag push.

| Target | Command | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Linux** | `npm run dist:linux` | `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.rpm`, `.pacman` |
| **Windows** | `npm run dist:win` | `.exe` (NSIS installer) |
| **macOS** | `npm run dist:mac` | `.dmg` |

The CI workflow downloads and bundles all third-party binaries (tun2socks, v2ray,
wireguard, wintun) automatically. No manual binary management is required.

  R["Renderer\n(sandboxed, contextIsolation)"]
  P["Preload\n(Context Bridge)"]
  M["Main Process\n(Node.js)"]
  H["chibatunnel-helper\n(SYSTEM / root)"]
  OS["OS Network Stack\nWireGuard / TUN"]

  R -->|"safe IPC only"| P
  P -->|"whitelisted channels"| M

  H --> OS

  style R fill:#1a1a2e,color:#fff
  style H fill:#2d1b4e,color:#fff
  style OS fill:#0d3b2e,color:#fff
```

**Threat model notes**:
- Mnemonics never leave the main process
- The IPC surface between renderer and main is minimal and typed
- The helper accepts connections only on localhost — not exposed to the network
- All privileged commands are validated and type-checked before execution
